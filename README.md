### Project Description<a name="description"></a>

The project aims to build a robust machine learning model in determining customers behavior of Starbucks rewards mobile app. The data sets provided are simulated version of the rewards mobile app data. The data sets are cleaned, explored, processed into one master DataFrame which is fed into various machine learning models. The machine learning model with ideal learning curve and high accuracy is determined to be the best fit for this project.

### Files<a name="files"></a>

The files are organized as follows. In this repository, the data sets from Starbucks are not included due to their large size.
